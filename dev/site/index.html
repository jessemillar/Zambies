		Yup!  Zambies! is a game.  I made a game.  It's an iOS game.  iOS is <b>cool</b>.  But...what's a zambie?
		<br>
		<br>
		<center>I have no idea.</center>
		<br>
		All I know is that they chase you and you die when you touch one.  Oh, and they explode when you shoot them.
		<br>
		<br>
		Maybe they're zombies, but probably not.  Maybe they're fairies.  Maybe they're the dust bunnies under your couch finally seeking revenge for their fallen comrades.
		<br>
		<br>
		<center>What they are is up to you.</center>
		<br>
		Just make sure you shoot them, kay?  And share our highscore.  Highscores are <b>cool</b> too.
